# Mono Bugs - Game Off 2021

Mono Bugs is a Game made for the Github Game Off 2021 in which you are the Hero who is dedicated to protect his Land of Monochromes from the mass attack of a big group of some Bugs. You have to travel across the Land and find the Boss Bug and defeat it in order to get rid of them. You will also gain access to a power called Aura, which will aid you in defeating the bugs. You can also collect coins on your journey.

## Getting the Game
You can find the game on Github [releases](https://github.com/HarshNarayanJha/Game-Off-2021/releases/tag/v1.0.0) section or on [itch.io](https://harshnarayanjha.itch.io/mono-bugs) page of the game

## Controls
To Move, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys. You may also use A and D keys.

To Jump, use the UP arrow key (again W key works as well). Logically Crouching should be done using the DOWN arrow key (also S key). Also, Crouching in mid-air will allow you to fall down in-place.

Using the Z key, you can control the Zoom Level of the camera among three different levels, Close, Mid and Far.

Then with the SPACEBAR key, you can release an Aura which will kill your enemies. Beware that you can't jump or crouch or collect coins which your Aura is active.

Good News, we support Gamepad too, with the LEFT STICK controlling Movement, NORTH BUTTON and SOUTH BUTTON for Jumping and Crouching respectively, LEFT SHOULDER for the Camera Zoom Level, and RIGHT SHOULDER or EAST BUTTON for the Aura.
