To move the player, you guessed it, use the <color=black>LEFT</color> and <color=black>RIGHT</color> arrow keys. You may also use <color=black>A</color> and <color=black>D</color> keys.

For Jumping, use the <color=black>UP</color> arrow key (again <color=black>W</color> key works as well). Logically Crouching should be done using the <color=black>DOWN</color> arrow key (also <color=black>S</color> key).

Using the <color=black>Z</color> key, you can control the zoom level of the camera among three different levels, Close, Mid and Far (go ahead and try it out).

Good News, we support Gamepad too, with the <color=black>LEFT STICK</color> controlling left/right movement, <color=black>NORTH BUTTON</color> and <color=black>SOUTH BUTTON</color> for jumping and crouching respectively, and <color=black>LEFT SHOULDER</color> for the camera zoom level.
